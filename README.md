## C pool EPITECH

The C Pool is the foundation of the Epitech curriculum. 

# ON THE AGENDA: UNIX shell, C language, school life 

-Basics of UNIX system utilization, fundamental elements of C language, Makefiles and a few data structures. All of the materials are available in video format. Assistants (the Asteks) are here to help you. 

-Regular hands-on workshops that will enable you to apply the initial concepts you will have acquired, and especially enable you to start forming your own hypotheses and to start performing tests in order to find solutions. Just so you know, the course does not explain how to solve the exercise. 

- Also, in order to avoid losing your rhythm over the weekend: * Rush: a type of mini-project to be completed in small groups 

This very first unit is important. It marks the beginning of a new educational approach; a new way of working. Keep in mind the schoolâ€™s objective: to transform you into innovative and in-demand professionals. As long as you settle for learning existing solutions found by others, you will never ne capable of becoming inventive. Starting with the very first C-Pool exercise that you will be asked to submit, you will not have all of the key elements nor will you have mastered all of the tools. You will have to form hypotheses, run tests, and compare notes with classmates in order to share ideas. You won't learn anything if we give you the solution.
